# some steps to take note of
 
1. base case
2. recurrence relation
3. processing at the right place
4. trust the function that it will handle(means just solve for one and others will be handled)
5. think logic/code in form of simple english language
6. the function statement is replaced by the value it returns and also give attention to the args that are passed the fnc
7. take care of the flow of code(like head recursion vs tail recursion)
8. A function is finished due to a return value or the code inside it is finished, after that it returns to it's ancestor function to the exact code line where it's called.
9. Always keep accurate track of the code-flow; 
10. In many ques, recursion flow follows the dfs to the base case, and the answers are generally build up from the base case.
11. In many ques, First draw the base recursion tree or, the pseudo login, and then write code according to it.
